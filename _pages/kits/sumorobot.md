SumoRobots are an amazing way to learn the basics of programming and electronics in a fun and interactive way. Robot-sumo, or pepe-sumo, is a sport in which two robots attempt to push each other out of a circle (in a similar fashion to the sport of sumo). The robots used in this competition are called sumobots.

The hardware and software of the SumoRobot kit is open-source, you can find everything on [GitHub](https://github.com/robokoding) and don't forget to checkout the development [gallery](https://goo.gl/photos/vJf1QYrnvfJTh55V8). The SumoRobot kit consists of all the necessary parts to build your own SumoRobot.

The SumoRobot can be programmed over the browser using a graphical programming interface or Python code. The SumoRobot parts kit costs €55 and will be announced on [Tindie](https://www.tindie.com/stores/silbo/). Contact [info@robokoding.com]() for more info.

Price: €55  
Reccommended age: 7+
