## Assembly instructions

### 1. Break the PCB apart

Start by taking the black board that has RoboKoding's logo on it. That is the PCB (meaning "printed circuit board") of the SumoRobot, where you will solder all the different components. If you look closer, you will notice tiny holes around the board. Those are the breakaway tabs that you need to separate into individual parts. Using pliers, carefully break off each part. After you separate all the parts, use a tool to smoothen the rough edges. You can use a wire cutter, scissors, a hand file or sand paper.

### 2. Solder the resistors

There are 11 resistors in the kit: 2 big blue, 5 small beige and 4 small blue resistors - all of them with different colour codes indicating the resistance value. Flip the SumoBoard on its backside and place them according to the numbers shown below:

Big blue resistors > R1, R2 = 0.1 ohm
Small beige resistors > R3, R4, R5, R6, R7, = 100 ohm
Small blue resistors > R10, R11 = 100K ohm 
 
Bend the resistor legs 90 degrees and place them on the SumoBoard. You can place and solder them one by one, or all together.  They don't have polarity, which means that you can place them in any of orientation on the board.

Cut the remainder of the resistor's legs and keep the remainders on the side, for a later step.

### 3. Solder the phototransistors

Find the two phototransistors - these are the light sensors that help the SumoRobot detect the line on the SumoRing. They are polarized, therefore pay close attention to the white drawing on the SumoBoard. The drawing corresponds to the shape of the phototransistor, therefore showing you the right way to place it on the board.  Bend the legs 90 degrees, place them on the board (labels: D1, D2 and D3, D4) and then solder them.

### 4. Solder the microcontroller

For this step you need the microcontroller, the pair of male pin headers and the pair of female pin headers. Place the female pin headers on the markings J4 and J5 on the board. Afterwards put the male pin headers into the microcontroller and place them on the board, into the female pin headers. Then solder the male pin headers to the microcontroller and the female pin headers to the SumoBoard.

### 5. Solder the servo pin headers

The 2 pin headers for the Servos go to the holes with the labels LEFT_SERVO and RIGHT_SERVO. Place the pin header and solder one of its pins first. Then try to align the pin header while reheating the previously made solder connection.

### 6. Solder the capacitors

The two green cylinders are the capacitors and they should be placed on the C1 and C2 markings. They have polarity, which means that you have to be careful how you place them on the board. On one side of the capacitor's body there is a grey stripe. The capacitor's leg from the striped side goes into the SumoBoard hole which is marked as a half circle filled with white colour. After you make sure you got the polarity right, solder the capacitors on the SumoBoard.

### 7. Solder the plow

Find the plow and the two silver breakaway tabs from the first step. We will use those to connect the plow to the main board. After you attach everything together, apply solder on both sides of the board.

![sumoboard](/assets/img/v031/step7.jpg){:width="50%"}
![sumoboard](/assets/img/v031/step7_1.jpg){:width="50%"}

Then, take the remainders of the resistors' legs from step 2. Place them in the holes on the board as shown on the image below. Solder them on both sides of the board, as well.

### 8. Solder the LEDs

Find the three LEDs - one blue and two yellow. Place the yellow ones in the holes with labels D6 and D7, while the blue one in the hole marked as D5. Be aware of the polarity again. Take a closer look and notice how the specific shape of the LED corresponds to the drawing on the board. You should place the shorter leg of the LED into the hole with a rectangular pad of the SumoBoard. After you make sure the polarity has the right orientation on the board, solder the yellow LEDs. The blue LED is placed in a more specific way. After you place the shorter leg in the hole marked with a rectangular shape, push the longer leg through the space between the plow and the main board. Then, from underneath, place it through the hole with an oval pad on the SumoBoard.

### 9. Solder the ultrasonic sensor

Find the ultrasonic sensor. This one helps the robot to detect objects, i.e. "to see" the opponent on the SumoRing. Push it in the holes labeles as J1 on the board and solder it into place.

### 10. Solder the power button

Put the power button in the SW1 labeled holes. Once again the polarity is important again - check the sides of the button, they should match with the drawing on the SumoBoard.

### 11.Prepare the wheels

The two wheels should be attached to the servo motors, so the robot can execute the movement commands. Find the two black screws from the bag and screw them to the wheels.

### 12. Place the servo motors

Place the servomotors on the SumoBoard, on top of the labels LEFT_SERVO and RIGHT_SERVO. The positioning is important - the gear that sticks out from the motor should face towards the back of the robot. The Servomotors cables should go towards the back of the robot, where the open source hardware logo is. Afterwards, secure them with the two black breakaway tabs from the first step. Insert the screws from up, the bolts from down and then screw them together. When this is done, you can put the cables under the microcontroller, as shown in the pictures below.

### 13. Connect the battery

First cut the power cable into half. Leave around 5.5cm on the connector side and 6.5cm on the other side. See the image below.

![sumoboard](/assets/img/sumoboard_battery_wire_cutting.jpg){:width="50%"}

Then trim of the isolation from the cable ends and add some solder to them. Next prepare the battery, add some solder to the negative pad and to the positive. You have to peal of the isolation on the positive pad, the transparent one. Then solder the black wire to the golden negative plate and the positive to the silver looking positive strip. Keep in mind that heating the battery too much is not good, so it's best to solder the wires quickly. See the image below.

![sumoboard](/assets/img/sumoboard_battery_wire_soldering.jpg){:width="50%"}

Put the battery on top of the servo motors, so that the red wire is closer to the push button and then pull tight the zip ties and cut them.

Finally place the red and black wire from the battery from top trough the SumoBoard holes to connect them to J7 and J8. Bend the cables into the holes and solder them.

TIP: Be careful that the power button SW1, which was soldered earlier, is turned OFF. The push buttons blue push part (the part that is moving) should extend out more in the OFF position than in the ON position as drawn on the SumoBoard.

## Usage instructions

To turn ON the SumoRobot push the power button towards right (ON). To turn the SumoRobot OFF, push it to the left (OFF).

In order to charge it, the SumoRobot has to be turned ON. Once you plug the micro USB into the SumoRobot's microcontroller, the red charging LED will light up and the microcontroller will go to sleep (turn OFF LED lights). Once the battery is full the red LED light will turn off.

Connecting to WiFi is possible using the [SumoManager](/kits/sumorobot/sumomanager) app. The blue LED under the SumoRobot will blink when it's trying to connect to the WiFi network. Once connected to WiFi the blue LED will be steady ON.

The yellow LED lights indicate if the SumoRobot is seeing a line. This works only on the SumoField or on a white paper with a thick black line. There are two line sensors under the plow of the SumoRobot, on the left and right. You can print your own SumoField on a A0 paper at a local print shop, download it [here](/assets/docs/sumofield.pdf).

The blue LED light indicates if the SumoRobot sees something in front of it. It sees about 40cm in distance.
