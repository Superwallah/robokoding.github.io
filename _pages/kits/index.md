				<p>Sumorobots are an amazing way to learn the basics of programming and electronics in a fun and interactive way. Robot-sumo, or pepe-sumo, is a sport in which two robots attempt to push each other out of a circle (in a similar fashion to the sport of sumo). The robots used in this competition are called sumobots.</p>
