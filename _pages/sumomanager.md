## Connecting the SumoRobot
Once you have your SumoRobot assembled you will need to upload it's software (firmware)  
on it. This can be done with the SumoManager, you can download it above. Once you launch  
the SumoManager you will see that it asks you to connect your SumoRobot with your  
computer using a micro USB cable. Once your SumoRobot is connected the SumoManager will  
try to load the WiFi networks the SumoRobot sees around him. This will fail as there is  
no firmware on the SumoRobot yet.
