Through an applied approach, the children acquire skills in disciplines such as robotics, programming, electronics and mechanics.
They will learn how to build circuits, solder and assemble a SumoRobot and program it.  
The course is based on non-formal methodologies of learning and teaching like hands-on experience, trial and error and peer
learning. The main aim of the course is to provide a learning environment where children acquire the skills and the mindset to
build their own inventions.
