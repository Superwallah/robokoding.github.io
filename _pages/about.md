		<h3>STORY</h3>
		<p>In his childhood, Silver became fascinated with robots. He grew up taking things apart, learning how they work and learning how to repair them. From then on, he started building many DIY projects. During high school, he discovered his passion for coding. Starting his bachelor's, Silver joined the Robotics Club of the Estonian IT College, and finally got the opportunity to build his own robots. He learned about open-source and became a passionate maker. He started developing a SumoRobot platform and teaching children around Estonia programming and robotics. That was the stepping stone towards founding RoboKoding. Silver's primary motivation was making robotics and coding easily accessible and available to as many children as possible. He started traveling around Europe, discovering new tools and looking for potential like-minded teammates. Today RoboKoding is a dynamic startup with a team determined to develop innovative technologies and learning tools in order to enable children to acquire the skills of the future.</p>
