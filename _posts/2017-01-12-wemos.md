Today the [WEMOS D1 mini pro](https://www.wemos.cc/product/d1-mini-pro.html) arrived and I made my first sketch for it. I just had to install the USB to UART [driver](https://www.silabs.com/products/mcu/Pages/USBtoUARTBridgeVCPDrivers.aspx) for it and it was ready to go. I was interested to try the over the air programming (OTA) and loading [Google Blockly](https://developers.google.com/blockly/) to it's on board SPI flash memory, so it can be served from it.
