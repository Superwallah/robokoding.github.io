The sumorobot kit is an amazing tool to learn about science, technology, engineering and mathematics in a fun and interactive way. [Robot-sumo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot-sumo), or pepe-sumo, is a sport in which two robots attempt to push each other out of a circle (in a similar fashion to the sport of sumo). The robots used in this competition are called sumobots.

The hardware and software of the sumorobot kit is open-source, you can find everything on [GitHub](https://github.com/robokoding) and don't forget to checkout the development [gallery](https://goo.gl/photos/vJf1QYrnvfJTh55V8). The kit consists of all the necessary parts to build your own sumorobot. Furthermore the kit contains 2 sumorobots and a field, so you can compete against the preprogrammed behavior of the other robot or invite your friend or family to play together.

Then lay down the field and place the sumorobots and test your code and may the best one win.
