Sumorobots are an amazing way to learn about science, technology, engineering and mathematics in a fun and interactive way. [Robot-sumo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot-sumo), or pepe-sumo, is a sport in which two robots attempt to push each other out of a circle (in a similar fashion to the sport of sumo). The robots used in this competition are called sumobots.

The hardware and software of the sumorobot kit is open-source, you can find everything on [GitHub](https://github.com/robokoding) and don't forget to checkout the development [gallery](https://goo.gl/photos/vJf1QYrnvfJTh55V8). The sumorobot kit consists of all the necessary parts to build your own sumorobot.
